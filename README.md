In this study, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.


Through the analysis of the data obtained by this study there are three main conclusions we are able to draw. First, the average tumor volume is signicantly lower for those mice using Capomulin and Ramicane. This finding seems to support the preference of Capomulin and provide an alternative in Ramicane.
